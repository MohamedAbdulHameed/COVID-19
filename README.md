# COVID-19
This is where I upload all the file used in analyzing the COVID-19 spread data in Egypt.

I also created a daliy updated Google Sheet that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/197eWnFC425nirQmPhiR2XznPt9kGe8oBTrWTFB-zXoE/edit?usp=sharing

To generate the plots, run `analysis.sh` in a Linux terminal.
