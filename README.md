# COVID-19
This is where I upload all the files used in analyzing the COVID-19 spread data in Egypt.

Sources of data:
  1. The official statements of the Egyptian Minstry of Health.
  2. This daily updated Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/197eWnFC425nirQmPhiR2XznPt9kGe8oBTrWTFB-zXoE/edit?usp=sharing

To generate the plots, run `daily_new_cases.py`.
